# Lists & ToDo List App
This is a basic lists app which helps you create and manage many lists. App is created using basic fuctions and file manipulation. It runs on the command line interface.

One can use it as a todo list or as any other list as well. 
I've provided a [Shopping list](https://github.com/VishalxRana/One-Day-Builds-Python-Projects/blob/main/Lists%20%26%20Todo%20List%20App/Shopping.txt) which was created using this program. 

You can:
- Create new lists
- Add to list 
- View the contents of the list
- Delete Items or tasks in list
- Exit out of the whole program

*The project was built from scratch!*
