# Lists & ToDo List App
This is a basic lists app which helps you create and manage many lists. It runs on the command line interface. 

One can use it as a todo list or as any other list as well. 
I've provided a Shopping list which was created using this program. 

You can:
- Create new lists
- Add to list 
- View the contents of the list
- Delete Items or tasks in list
- Exit out of the whole program

*The project was built from scratch!*
