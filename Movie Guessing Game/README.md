# Movie Guessing Game
There is a list of movies in [movies.py](https://github.com/VishalxRana/One-Day-Builds-Python-Projects/blob/main/Movie%20Guessing%20Game/movies.py) from which the game randomly selects a movie and you have to guess it. \
This is a CLI based app and the idea was taken from the hangman game.
